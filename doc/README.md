Aixcoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Aixcoin Core is the original Aixcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Aixcoin transactions, which requires several hundred gigabytes or more of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to several days or more.

To download Aixcoin Core, visit [aixcoincore.org](https://aixcoincore.org/en/download/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Aixcoin Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/aixcoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/aixcoind` (headless)
- `bin/aixcoin` (wrapper command)

The `aixcoin` command supports subcommands like `aixcoin gui`, `aixcoin node`, and `aixcoin rpc` exposing different functionality. Subcommands can be listed with `aixcoin help`.

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run aixcoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Aixcoin Core to your applications folder, and then run Aixcoin Core.
